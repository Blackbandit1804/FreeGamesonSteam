# Contributing to FreeGamesonSteam

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to FreeGamesonSteam, that is hosted in the [FreeGamesonSteam](https://github.com/Nickwasused/FreeGamesonSteam) 
on GitHub.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [FreeGamesonSteam](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. 
Please report unacceptable behavior to [nickwasused.services@protonmail.com](mailto:nickwasused.services@protonmail.com).

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#FreeGamesonSteam) your bug is related to, 
create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/Nickwasused/FreeGamesonSteam/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the 
guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of FreeGamesonSteam) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of FreeGamesonSteam?** What's the most recent version in which the 
problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of FreeGamesonSteam from [the releases page](https://github.com/Nickwasused/FreeGamesonSteam/releases).
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of FreeGamesonSteam are you using?** You can get the exact version by running opening the Script in your terminal.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
